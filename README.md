## Inclusion in Patrons

Inclusion in Patrons file is limited to those that donated $20 or more to the
[Firestorm Kickstarter](kickstarter.com/projects/1003377429/firestorm-an-open-source-forum-in-phoenix-from-eli).
We'd like to thank everyone that made Firestorm possible! Without your help the
project wouldn't be as awesome as it is. If you donated and are missing from the
Patrons file and wish to be included, it means you missed the backer survey.
No worries though! To get ourself added, please do the following:

* Email us at support@dailydrip.com and let us know your name and donation amount
* Add yourself to `/data/patrons.json`
* Validate the resulting JSON file with [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)
* Open a pull request with your newly added info

We will then reconcile the two, merge your PR and deploy the changes.
